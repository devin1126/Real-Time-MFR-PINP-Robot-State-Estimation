# Real-Time-MFR-PINP-Robot-State-Estimation
Implementation of multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP)-based state estimation ROS2 node. Capable of being ran on edge devices like Raspberry Pi at ~50 Hz. (Future TODO: Gradient updates will be offloaded to a remote computer for even further real-time feasibility). Includes additional residual, attention-based deep Kalman filter baseline. For further details on results and analysis while using UKF (unscented Kalman filter) ground-truth for training, observe our findings [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08231).
